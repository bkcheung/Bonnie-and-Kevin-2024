  lyrics: `My Jesus my Saviour\n\
Lord there is none like you\n\
All of my days I want to praise \n\
The wonders of your mighty love\n\
\n\
My comfort my shelter\n\
Tower of refuge and strength\n\
Let every breath all that I am\n\
Never cease to worship you\n\
\n\
Shout to the Lord\n\
All the earth let us sing\n\
Power and majesty\n\
Praise to the king\n\
Mountains bow down\n\
And the seas will roar\n\
At the sound of your name\n\
\n\
I sing for joy\n\
At the work of your hands\n\
Forever I'll love you\n\
Forever I'll stand\n\
Nothing compares\n\
To the promise I have in you\n\
\n\
My Jesus my Saviour\n\
Lord there is none like you\n\
All of my days I want to praise\n\
The wonders of your mighty love\n\
\n\
My comfort my shelter\n\
Tower of refuge and strength\n\
Let every breath all that I am\n\
Never cease to worship you\n\
\n\
Shout to the Lord\n\
All the earth let us sing\n\
Power and majesty\n\
Praise to the king\n\
Mountains bow down\n\
And the seas will roar\n\
At the sound of your name\n\
\n\
I sing for joy\n\
At the work of your hands\n\
Forever I'll love you\n\
Forever I'll stand\n\
Nothing compares\n\
To the promise I have in you\n\
\n\
Death could not hold You\n\
The veil tore before You\n\
You silenced the boast of sin and grave\n\
The Heavens are roaring\n\
The praise of Your glory\n\
For You are raised to life again\n\
\n\
You have no rival\n\
You have no equal\n\
Now and forever God You reign\n\
Yours is the Kingdom\n\
Yours is the glory\n\
Yours is the Name above all names\n\
\n\
What a powerful Name it is\n\
What a powerful Name it is\n\
The Name of Jesus Christ my King\n\
What a powerful Name it is\n\
Nothing comes close to this\n\
What a powerful Name it is\n\
The Name of Jesus\n\
\n\
What a powerful Name it is\n\
The Name of Jesus`,

  lyrics: `The splendor of a King\n\
Clothed in majesty\n\
Let all the earth rejoice\n\

He wraps Himself in light\n\
And darkness tries to hide\n\
Trembles at His voice\n\
Trembles at His voice\n\

How great is our God sing with me\n\
How great is our God and all will see\n\
How great how great\n\
Is our God\n\
\n\
Age to age He stands\n\
And time is in His hands\n\
Beginning and the end\n\
Beginning and the end\n\
\n\
The Godhead three in one\n\
Father Spirit Son\n\
The Lion and the Lamb\n\

How great is our God sing with me\n\
How great is our God and all will see\n\
How great how great\n\
Is our God\n\

You’re the name above all names\n\
You are worthy of all praise\n\
My heart will sing\n\
How great is our God x2\n\
